Hello there !

This project is my very first project in Rust, and it follows the tutorial given by "The Book", so that I can get used to the fundamentals of the language before starting a personnal and challenging project.
Here is the link to the tutorial I followed : [Click here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)

This very small project is very simple, you must guess the secret number chosen by the game !

### Run the project

* Open the cloned repositroy's in a terminal
* Go to the ``guessing_game`` folder : 
```sh

Enjoy the game !
